# Solar-Panel-Light-Tracking-System
This code controls a solar tracking system for a solar panel using two servomotors (horizontal and vertical). The servos adjust the panelâ€™s position based on light intensity readings from four LDR sensors. The system is implemented on an **ESP32** microcontroller and sends data to **ThingSpeak** via Wi-Fi.
